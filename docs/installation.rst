Installation
============

General preparation
-------------------

Rampy runs with a traditional Python stack.

If you are not familiar with Python, you can first have a look at the `scipy lecture notes<https://scipy-lectures.org/>`_,
a set of tutorials for the beginner.

You can install `Anaconda Python<https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>`_ to get a running Python distribution. See the documentation of Anaconda for those steps.

Rampy installation
------------------

Install with pip in the command line:

 ``pip install rampy``

If you want to use gcvspline and cvxpy, also install those:

 ``pip install gcvspline``

 ``pip install cvxpy``

 Please note that gcvspline installation may require gfortran, see `gcvspline documentation <https://charlesll.github.io/gcvspline/>`_.
