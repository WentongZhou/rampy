Rampy is a Python library that aims at helping processing spectroscopic data, such as Raman, Infrared or XAS spectra.
It offers, for instance, functions to subtract baselines as well as to stack, resample or smooth spectra.
It aims at facilitating the use of Python in processing spectroscopic data.
It integrates within a workflow that uses Numpy/Scipy as well as optimisation libraries such as lmfit or emcee, for instance.

The project is hosted on Github (`here! <https://github.com/charlesll/rampy>`_), please do not hesitate to propose new features or simply ideas!
